    Computes the trustworthiness score to evaluate how well the local structure 
    is preserved after dimensionality reduction.
    
    Parameters:
    - D: numpy array, the distance matrix in the original high-dimensional space.
    - D_embedded: numpy array, the distance matrix in the lower-dimensional space.
    - n_neighbors: int, the number of nearest neighbors to consider.

    - float: Trustworthiness score in the range [0, 1], where 1 indicates perfect preservation.
